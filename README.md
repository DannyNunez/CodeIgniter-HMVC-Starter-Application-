CodeIgniter HMVC Starter Application
============


Project Goal
------------

A skeleton application based on CodeIgniter. The overall goal of this project is to provide a HMVC skeleton application based on CodeIgniter and using some of the most popular CodeIgniter libraries. This is not a cms, but just a bare bones CodeIgniter install with a few extras to take care of some of the boring work. 

Features 
-----------

**HMVC Modules**

I have included **wiredesignz** HMVC extension. The HMVC extension makes CodeIgniter modular. Modules allow you to bundle your code into what boils down as little mini CodeIgniter Applications. For more information on the how the extension works please click on the link below. 

This is [**wiredesignz's**](https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc "wiredesignz hmvc extension") HMVC extension repo hosted on bitbucket.org.

**ION_AUTH Authentication System**

I have also included Ben Edmunds ION_AUTH authentication library and a few minor adjustments to make it work with the HMVC extension. Ben has produced great documentation that you can find [**here**](http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/ "ION_AUTH authentication library") to learn exactly how it works.

**Simple Assets Library**

A great Assests library created by Boris Strahija. This library adds support for combining, minifying and obfuscating your JavaScript and CSS assets. Additionally there's a [**LessPHP**](http://leafo.net/lessphp/ "LessPHP Compiler") compiler, a [**PHPSass**](https://github.com/richthegeek/phpsass "PHPSass Compiler")compiler and a [**CoffeeScript**](https://github.com/alxlit/coffeescript-php "CoffeeScript Compiler") compiler.

**CodeIgniter base CRUD model**

A CodeIgniter Base Model that is an extended CI_Model class to use in your CodeIgniter applications. It provides a full CRUD base to make developing database interactions easier and quicker, as well as an event-based observer system, in-model data validation, intelligent table name guessing and soft delete.
This was developed by [**Jamie Rumbelow**](https://github.com/jamierumbelow "Jamie Rumbelow"). Jamie is well known in the CodeIgniter community and has written three books on CodeIgniter. I recommend anyone looking to truly understand how to develop and unit test web application using CodeIgniter invest in these books. They can be found [**here**](https://efendibooks.com/books "Jamie Rumbelow CodeIgniter Books").

**HTML 5 Boilerplate's .htaccess file**

I have used [**HTML 5 Boilerplate's .htaccess file**](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs/tree/master/apache "HTML 5 Boilerplate's .htaccess file") to provide you with the majority of best practice server rules for making web pages fast and secure. I have also added the redirect to get rid of that pesky index.php from your urls.
